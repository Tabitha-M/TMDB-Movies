*Movie Data Analysis*

This repository contains an analysis of movie data to identify trends and factors influencing movie profitability. The findings are based on a dataset containing information about various movies, including their genres, release years, budgets, and revenues.

*Conclusions*

After conducting the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

Drama is the most popular genre, followed by action, comedy, and thriller.
Drama, comedy, thriller, and action are the four most-produced genres.
The maximum number of movies was released in the year 2014.
'Avatar', 'Star Wars', and 'Titanic' are the most profitable movies.
Short or long-duration movies are more popular than long-duration movies.
The average runtime of movies is decreasing year by year.
May, June, November, and December are the most popular months for releasing movies if you want to maximize profit.
Revenue is directly connected to the budget.
Warner Bros, Universal Pictures, and Paramount Pictures production companies earn more lifetime profit than other production companies.
Movies with higher budgets have shown a corresponding increase in revenues.


*Limitations*
It's important to note the following limitations of this analysis:

The findings are not a 100 percent guaranteed solution for predicting movie profitability. They provide a high probability of making high profits if similar characteristics are present, but there are other influential factors that need to be considered.
During the data cleaning process, the data was split using '|' into lists for easy parsing during the exploration phase. This increased the time taken for calculating the results.
